## 1. INSTALL JAVA IF NEEDED ##

http://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp

## 2. DOWNLOAD AUTO PUSH INSTALLATION ZIP FILE ##

Download auto\_push installation zip file from:

http://code.google.com/p/pytivo-auto-push/downloads/list

  * **auto\_push\_vxxx.zip** file â€“ This contains the platform independent auto push installation files

## 3. UNPACK ZIP FILE ##

  * Unpack **auto\_push\_vxxx.zip** file to your desired location. In this example: /home/moyekj/auto\_push

### TIP ###
If upgrading from a previous Java auto push installation you can unzip over the previous installation or just replace the **auto\_push.jar** file of the old installation with the one from the new installation. That way you can preserve the auto push configuration and avoid having to re-configure. NOTE: In some cases there are other files part of a release, so you can also just unzip the file over the top of your previous installation to make sure you overwrite all files that make up an installation.


## STARTING AUTO PUSH ##
  * Run the **auto\_push** script in the installation folder to start auto push (/home/moyekj/auto\_push/auto\_push in this example).
  * The first time launch you will need to supply the full path to your **pyTivo.conf** file. You can double-click in the **pyTivo config file** field to bring up a file browser to help.
> NOTE: auto push detects Tivos on your network automatically using **Bonjour**, so you may have to grant permissions for this program to access your local network in order for the discovery to work.
  * Consult the [configuring\_auto\_push](http://code.google.com/p/pytivo-auto-push/wiki/configuring_auto_push) wiki page for details.
