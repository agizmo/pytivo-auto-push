=RELEASE NOTES=

==v0.1d (04/23/2010)==

*FIXES*
   * Fixed parsing problem for files with spaces when building list of already pushed files from .processed files. This problem would cause auto_push to try and push files that already had been pushed previously when re-starting auto_push.

==v0.1c (04/19/2010)==

*FIXES*
   * List of already pushed titles is rebuilt every time auto push checks for files to push now. There was a bug in previous release where when first starting auto push that already pushed files were being pushed.

==v0.1b (02/14/2010)==

*FIXES*
   * Updated pyTivo push call to work properly with change in pyTivo response to external push calls in recent releases. Prior to this fix auto_push would always get 404 (Not Found) response from pyTivo server for push requests and so auto_push would assume the push requests failed even though they would go through anyway.

==v0.1a (10/29/2009)==
