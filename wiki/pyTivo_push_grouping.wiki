A simple way to group a bunch of titles together on TiVo Now Playing List with pyTivo pushes:

1. Put all videos you want grouped together on TiVo in a single folder.

2. In that folder put a file named default.txt with following contents according to what you want to name the folder on TiVo:
seriesId : folderName

3. For each video in that folder, make an accompanying metadata file: 
For example, for the video video1.mpg, there would be a metadata file named video1.mpg.txt with the title name you want to have on TiVo:

title : This is video 1

(You can also add other tags such as *description* for example if you wish).
