A simple way to group a bunch of titles together on TiVo Now Playing List with pyTivo pushes:

1. Put all videos you want grouped together on TiVo in a single folder.

2. In that folder put a file named default.txt with a unique seriesId tag (doesn't matter what it is, just don't repeat it for other folder groupings):
seriesId : some_unique_folder_name

3. For each video in that folder, make an accompanying metadata file: 
For example, for the video video1.mpg, there would be a metadata file named video1.mpg.txt with the title name you want to have on TiVo:

title : This is video 1

(You can also add other tags such as *description* for example if you wish).

NOTE: The first file that is pushed will control the folder name, so in above example folder name would become video1, and subsequent videos in same folder would group under the same video1 folder.
