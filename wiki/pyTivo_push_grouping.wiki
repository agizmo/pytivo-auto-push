A simple way to group a bunch of titles together on TiVo Now Playing List with pyTivo pushes:

1. Put all videos you want grouped together on TiVo in a single folder.

2. In that folder put a file named default.txt with a unique seriesId tag (doesn't matter what it is, just don't repeat it for other folder groupings):
seriesId : some_unique_folder_name

3. For each video in that folder, make an accompanying metadata file: 
For example, for the video video1.mpg, there would be a metadata file named video1.mpg.txt with the title name you want to have on TiVo:

title : title1

(You can also add other tags such as *description* for example if you wish).

NOTE: The *title* of the first file that is pushed will control the folder name, so in above example folder name would become *title1*, and subsequent videos in same folder would group under the same *title1* folder.

FULL EXAMPLE:
1. Under a folder I have a default.txt file with:
seriesId : folder1

2. Same folder I have movie1.mpg with movie1.mpg.txt:
title : Kids Movies
description: This is Kid Movie 1

3. Push movie1.mpg

4. Same folder I now have movie2.mp4 with movie2.mp4.txt:
title : Kid Movie 2
description : This is Kid Movie 2

Result on TiVo:

Kids Movies (2)

   Kid Movie 2 (description=This is Kid Movie 2)

   Kids Movies (description=This is Kid Movie 1)
